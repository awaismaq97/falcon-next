# Falcon

A transparent inference environment built on Next.js, FastAPI, MongoDB, and OpenRouter. Falcon is not an assistant or chatbot — it is a bare inference layer with full context visibility, user-controlled memory, a complete audit trail, and experimental dual-run logging for structured output analysis.

> This document describes what Falcon **is** and how its concepts work. For how to **run and deploy** the app (local dev, Docker, DigitalOcean), see [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## What It Is

Falcon gives direct access to LLM inference with nothing hidden. Every component entering a generation — persona, system prompt, retrieved memories, conversation history — is labelled, inspectable, and editable. Memory is stored explicitly and retrieved visibly. Every inference event is logged in full.

It is designed for researchers and practitioners who need to observe model behavior precisely: what goes in, what comes out, whether instructions hold, and when they break.

---

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+ (the `falcon` conda env), Node 20+, a MongoDB Atlas cluster, and an OpenRouter API key.

Falcon runs as two services — a **FastAPI** backend (`backend/`) and a **Next.js** frontend (`frontend/`). The full, authoritative setup — local dev, Docker Compose, and DigitalOcean App Platform — lives in [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md). The short version:

```bash
# 1. Secrets — copy the template and fill in OPENROUTER_API_KEY + MONGODB_URI
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.example backend/.env

# 2. Backend (conda falcon env) — http://127.0.0.1:8017
conda run -n falcon python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8017   # from backend/

# 3. Frontend — http://localhost:3000
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Or run the whole stack in Docker (mirrors production): `docker compose up --build`, then open <http://localhost:8080>.

Runtime behaviour is controlled by [`backend/config.yaml`](backend/config.yaml), read **once when the backend starts**. Edit it while the backend is running and the change won't take effect until you restart. See [Persona](#persona) for how this affects persona seeding.

---

## Configuration

All runtime behaviour is controlled by `backend/config.yaml`. The `.env` file holds secrets only. Missing or invalid values raise an error at startup — nothing fails silently.

  config.yaml               — runtime config (models, persona, generation, judge prompt)
frontend/                         — Next.js 15 SPA (App Router, TS, Tailwind v4)
  src/app                   — pages + providers
  src/components            — Sidebar, the seven tabs, chat, UI primitives
  src/lib                   — typed API client, SSE client, Zustand store, TanStack Query hooks, types
```

The backend streams chat over **Server-Sent Events** (`POST /api/chat/send`); the blocking OpenAI/LangGraph generators run in a worker thread and are pumped to the event loop, so the loop never blocks. The backend is **stateless** — the frontend owns all settings and sends them per request. See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full architecture diagram.

### MongoDB Collections

| Collection | Contents |
|---|---|
| `identities` | `{identity_id, created_at}` — one doc per identity |
| `messages` | `{identity_id, timestamp, role, content}` — conversation history |
| `memory` | `{identity_id, memory_type, content, tags, pinned, source, created_at, updated_at}` |
| `traces` | Per-turn reasoning traces: `{identity_id, user_timestamp, steps, context_snapshot}` |
| `tokens` | Cumulative token usage per identity |
| `audit_log` | Full inference audit records — 13 fields per turn |
| `conversation_summaries` | `{identity_id, summary, turn_count, updated_at}` — one doc per identity |
| `dual_run_log` | Side-by-side dual-run records with breakthrough detection |

---

## Identities

An identity is a fully isolated context — its own conversation history, memory store, persona, token usage, audit trail, and dual-run log. Nothing leaks between identities.

- **Create** — enter a name in the sidebar and click `＋ Create`. The identity is registered immediately and seeded with the default persona **as loaded from `config.yaml` at backend startup** (see [Persona](#persona) for the restart caveat).
- **Switch** — select from the dropdown. History, memory, tokens, and audit are cached per identity, so switching away and back is instant and does not re-read from the database.
- **Delete** — removes everything: messages, memory, traces, tokens, audit records, summaries, and the identity registry entry. A spinner is shown while the deletes run.

The `default` identity always exists and cannot be deleted.

> **Performance:** Per-identity history, traces, memory, and audit summaries are cached in session state on first load and reused across reruns. The database is only re-read when the underlying data actually changes (send, clear, or edit). Audit records are loaded as lightweight summaries first, with the full per-turn payload fetched on demand.

---

## Memory

Memory is user-controlled and retrieval is always visible. Six types:

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `semantic` | Long-term facts, domain knowledge, concepts |
| `episodic` | Specific past events and notable interactions |
| `procedural` | Learned behaviours, stated preferences, workflow patterns |
| `working` | Short-term scratch space for the current session |
| `archive` | Aged-out or low-relevance entries — excluded from active retrieval |
| `persona` | The identity's behaviour definition — always injected first |

### Retrieval

Before each generation, relevant memory is retrieved using a weighted scoring formula:

```
score = (recency_rank_score × recency_weight) + (overlap_score × relevance_weight)
```

- `recency_rank_score` — `1/(rank+1)`, rank 0 is the newest entry
- `overlap_score` — tag match → keyword match → 0.0; pinned entries always score 1.0
- Top `top_k_per_type` entries per active type are returned
- Persona is always prepended — never scored, never dropped
- Archive is never retrieved

Retrieval results, per-entry scores, and match reasons are visible in the **Context** tab after every turn.

### Automatic Extraction

After every turn, a background LLM call (using `extraction_model`) classifies the exchange into typed memory entries and persists them with `source="auto"`. It only extracts facts about the user — never self-descriptions of the model, greetings, or turn metadata. A hard code-level filter (`_should_reject`) catches anything the prompt misses.

### Persona

Each identity has one persona entry. It is injected as the first system message on every turn, wrapped with:

```
[PERSONA — this defines your identity and behavior. Adopt it completely for this conversation.]
<persona content>
```

Edit it any time from the **Memory tab → Edit Persona**. The four fields (name, tone, communication style, core traits) are stored as a single structured string and parsed back for display.

### Persona seeding from `config.yaml`

The `default_persona` block in `config.yaml` is read **once when the backend starts**. Two things follow from this:

- **Editing `config.yaml` requires a restart.** A running backend keeps the persona it loaded at startup, so newly created identities are seeded with that *old* value until you restart. If a new identity shows a persona you thought you changed, restart the backend.
- **Only the identity named in `default_persona.identity` (default: `default`) is re-synced.** On each startup its DB persona is overwritten to match `config.yaml`. All other identities are seeded **once at creation** and never updated afterward — edit them individually in the Memory tab if you change the config later.

### History Modes

Three modes are available from the sidebar:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `raw` | Sends the last N conversation turns (default) |
| `summary` | Sends an AI-generated summary of the full conversation, no raw turns |
| `hybrid` | Sends the summary first, then the last N raw turns |

Summaries are generated in a background thread after each turn by `summarizer.py` and stored in `conversation_summaries`.

---

## Inference Pipeline

Each turn follows this sequence:

1. Log user message → `messages` collection
2. Retrieve relevant memory (weighted scoring, 500ms timeout)
3. Assemble payload via `build_annotated_payload`:
   - `persona` block — system message, always first
   - `system-prompt` block — system message, if enabled
   - `memory` block — system message, grouped by type
   - `history-summary` block — system message, for summary/hybrid modes
   - `history` — raw conversation turns (truncated to last N)
   - `user-input` — current message
4. Stream response via OpenRouter (`stream=True`, token-by-token)
5. Strip `<think>…</think>` blocks inline during streaming
6. Optionally pass through the **judge** (pass/suppress verdict) before display
7. Log assistant message
8. The answer is delivered to the UI immediately; all remaining work happens in background threads so the send never blocks:
   - **Memory extraction** — classifies the turn into typed entries (skipped if `memory_extraction_enabled` is false)
   - **Audit record** and **token counts** — persisted
   - **Conversation summary** — regenerated **only in `summary` / `hybrid` history modes** (skipped in `raw`, where it would never be used)
   - **Dual-run** — if enabled, two additional inference calls fire and the comparison record is logged

Extracted entries are persisted in the background and appear the next time the Memory tab is opened or refreshed.

### Judge

When enabled, generation is buffered silently, then evaluated by a second LLM call that returns `{"verdict": "pass"|"suppress", "reason": "..."}`. Suppressed responses are replaced with `[suppressed]` and never committed to history. The judge model is selected independently in the sidebar.

---

## Dual-Run Logging

Dual-run logging sends each message through the model twice using an identical payload and records both outputs side by side. It is designed for structured observation — particularly for detecting when a given instruction holds versus when something unexpected breaks through.

### How it works

Enable **Dual Run** in the sidebar, then select your current **state tag** before sending. Each message fires two independent non-streaming inference calls (same payload, same settings). Both results are stored in the `dual_run_log` collection.

### State tags

Before sending, select your current state from the menu:

| Tag | Intended use |
|---|---|
| Neutral | Baseline — no particular condition |
| Focused | Active, directed attention |
| Coherence | Structured, integrative state |
| Grief process | Grief or emotionally significant processing |

The selected tag is stored alongside both outputs for every run, enabling comparison across conditions.

### What is logged per pair

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `state_tag` | Active state at time of send |
| `system_prompt` | Exact prompt text in effect |
| `user_input` | The message sent |
| `sun_instruction_active` | Whether ☀️ instruction was detected as active |
| `run1.text` / `run2.text` | Full output from each run |
| `run1.tokens` / `run2.tokens` | `{prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, total_tokens}` |
| `run1.timestamp` / `run2.timestamp` | UTC ISO 8601 |
| `run1.latency_ms` / `run2.latency_ms` | Wall-clock inference time |
| `run1.broke_through` / `run2.broke_through` | Whether the ☀️ instruction was held or broken |
| `run1.first_break` / `run2.first_break` | First word/token that appeared when the instruction broke |
| `any_breakthrough` | True if either run broke through |
| `recorded_at` | Record creation timestamp |

### Breakthrough detection

The ☀️ instruction is considered active when the string `☀️` appears in either the system prompt or the persona `core_traits`. If active, each run's output is tested:

- Output is purely `☀️` (possibly repeated or with whitespace) → **held** (`broke_through: false`)
- Output contains anything else → **breakthrough** (`broke_through: true`, `first_break` = first non-☀️ word)

This produces analysable data rather than impressions — exact records of what the model produced under each condition, across states, across runs.

### Dual Run tab

The **Dual Run** tab displays all logged records with:

- State tag coloured badges
- 🟢 HELD / 🔴 BREAKTHROUGH status per run
- First-break callout showing exactly what emerged when the instruction broke
- Token counts, latencies, and timestamps for each run
- Aggregate stats: total runs, breakthrough count, breakthrough rate, per-state breakdown
- Filter by All / Breakthroughs only / Held only
- JSON export and record deletion

---

## UI Tabs

### Chat
Standard chat interface. Responses stream token by token. Each assistant turn has a `⌥ context` button that opens a dialog showing the exact assembled payload sent to the model for that specific turn. Long histories render the most recent turns first, with a **Load older** button to page further back (it keeps your scroll position instead of jumping to the newest message).

### Context
Full context snapshot for the last turn: persona block, system prompt state, retrieved memory entries with scores and match reasons, history included/dropped counts, token estimate, and the raw assembled payload. Exportable as JSON.

### Memory
Full read/write access to the memory store:
- **Edit Persona** — edit the identity's four persona fields
- **Test Retrieval** — run a query and see scored retrieval results
- **Export** — download all memory as JSON
- Per-type tabs (Semantic, Episodic, Procedural, Working, Archive) — add, pin, tag, edit, delete, or bulk-clear entries

### Audit
Complete inference audit log. Every turn records: model, prompt state, system prompt text, retrieved memories, generation settings, context size, token estimate, raw model output, token usage, and latency. The list loads as lightweight summaries (heavy fields projected out) for speed; the full per-turn payload is fetched on demand via **Load full record**, and the full export is built only when you click **Prepare export**. Filterable by identity, exportable as JSON.

### Logs
Raw conversation history with per-turn edit, delete, and trace inspection. Trace view shows every stage of the inference pipeline with timestamps for that specific turn.

### Testing
Continuity experiments from `tests/continuity_tests.py`. Run predefined test variants against live APIs, review per-probe payloads and outputs, download full reports.

### Dual Run
Side-by-side dual-run log. See [Dual-Run Logging](#dual-run-logging) for full details.

## Sidebar Controls

The sidebar starts **collapsed** — open it with the `»` arrow at the top-left when you need to change something.

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| Identity selector | Switch between identities (cached — instant on repeat visits) |
| Create identity | Persists immediately and seeds the startup-loaded default persona |
| Delete identity | Removes all data for the current identity; shows a spinner while running |
| Model | Select from `available_models` in `config.yaml` |
| System prompt | Toggle on/off; edit inline. Off = no system message sent |
| Persona | Toggle on/off. Off = persona block excluded from payload |
| History Truncation | Max turns kept in context (0–100) |
| History Mode | Raw / Summary / Hybrid |
| Judge | Toggle on/off; select judge model independently |
| Payload Review | Preview assembled context before each send |
| Dual Run | Toggle on/off; select state tag (Neutral / Focused / Coherence / Grief process) |
| Generation Controls | Temperature, top_p, repetition_penalty, stop tokens |
| Session stats | Cumulative token usage for the current session |

---

## Design Principles

**No hidden injection.** If the system prompt toggle is off, nothing is prepended. No silent fallback to assistant mode, no default persona injected without the persona toggle being on.

**Always output.** The model always returns something. Empty output becomes `[no output]` rather than silence. Generation never fails silently for valid input.

**Full transparency.** Every source entering generation is labelled — `persona`, `system-prompt`, `memory`, `history`, `user-input` — and visible in the Context tab with the exact text sent.

**Identity isolation.** All database queries are scoped by `identity_id`. No cross-identity data leakage is possible at the query level.

**Visible retrieval.** Every memory entry retrieved, its score, and the reason it was selected are shown after every turn. Retrieval is not a black box.

**Explicit generation controls.** Temperature, top_p, and repetition_penalty are shown in the sidebar and recorded in every audit entry. Nothing is tuned silently between turns.

**Structured observation.** Dual-run logging produces records that can be analysed rather than relying on memory or impression. State tagging and breakthrough detection give the data structure that makes comparison meaningful.
